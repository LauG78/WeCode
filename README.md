# What is the WeCode project?

<br>

WeCode is a young professional agency that helps SME's grow their sales or service online, helps them GET online ( social media, images etc...), and provides them with the right marketing tools trough the WeCode website.

the project also holds that we help the SME's to be able to handle their own website so they dont always have to depend on others. we call this the *__the human touch__*


<br>
<br>

# Why WeCode?

<br>

for the greater good,
we are convinced that we can help SME's to crank up their sales by 30% for a humanly price.

>there you have that *__human touch__* again.

when you roam in our packages page you can choose the costum package. where we wil sit with you and discuss a fully personalized package. this means the price can also vary.

no project is too big or too small for the WeCode Team.
